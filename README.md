# Wut?!

We are looking for a new member for our team. So, in order to know you a little bit more we created a challenge.

# Our challenge

We are looking for a way that allows us to fetch our favorite movies from **omdbapi**, and mark them as favorites.

# Brief

- The app must have a basic form with a "search" field and a "search" button.
- When a user enters the movie name (or part of it) in the "search" field an presses the "search" button. The app should connect to http://www.omdbapi.com/, fetch and display the results.
- Every result must have a button to mark (or remove) them as favorite in our database.
- The favorites movies must have their own view as a list.

# The rules ðŸ‘€

- Fork this repository and create a PR.
- Use any framework and programming language you want.
- You can use any kind of platform to deploy (if you want) i.e.: heroku, gcp, aws, vps etc.
- You must give us a URL to view the result (duh).

# Time

- You have up to 6 days to submit the project, but if you need more time, don't worry, push your changes! quality is more important.
